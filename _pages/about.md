I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Fuzhou University in 2019,China. I am currently a second-year graduate student working on the interface of energy storage, power systems, electrochemistry, and artificial intelligence (AI). I work with Prof. Bizhong Xia and Xuan Zhang with a balanced focus on real-world application and theoretical depth.
